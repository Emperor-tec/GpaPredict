# Student CGPA Predicting System

## Overview
The **CGPA Predicting System** uses machine learning algorithms to predict the **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)** of students based on various academic parameters such as subject grades, attendance, and previous performance. This system helps educational institutions or students themselves forecast future academic performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **CGPA Prediction:** Predicts the final CGPA based on input features like subject grades, attendance, and past academic records.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for accurate predictions.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes the predicted CGPA vs. actual CGPA to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides performance metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared**, and others to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn for building models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Data Processing:** Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizing results.
- **Web Interface:** Flask for creating a web app for user interaction.
